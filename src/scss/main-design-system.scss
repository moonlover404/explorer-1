// This file is based off of `/assets/styles/main.scss` from repo: www-frontend
// However, to bundle everything properly outside of nuxt, we needed to make a few modifications
// Notably, this version adds tailwind styles and imports a couple other partials that nuxt was handling in www-frontend

// tailwind --------------------
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
// end tailwind ----------------

// main elements
@import "hover"; // added just for the bundle
@import "fonts"; // added just for the bundle. formerly /static/styles/font-face.css
@import "aspect-ratios";
@import "grid";
@import "typography";
@import "polyfills";
@import "animations";

// components
@import "components"; // added just for the bundle

// tailwind --------------------
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
// end tailwind ----------------
