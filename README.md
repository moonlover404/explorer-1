Inspired by:

- https://github.com/alexcanana/webpack-starter

## Getting started

- Currently, I've manually copied over the tailwind config, font files, scss files, and also created a couple scss files correspdonding to components.
- I've also made an index.html that demos some html markup.

```
npm run dev
```

When copying files from WWW:

- font-face.css needs to be renamed to \_fonts.scss and placed in scss folder

## Just compile a CSS file please

> Or if you just want to compile the CSS:

```
npm install -g postcss-cli
```
