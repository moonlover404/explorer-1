**This package is an active work-in-progress and not ready for use on other projects.** It will aim to include all of the frontend assets (bundled and scss) necessary to work with the html markup available through the [Explorer 1 Storybook](https://designlabinternal.domain/storybook/).

## Quick start

You will first need to configure your project for scoped usage of the internal.npm.registry registry.

1. In your application, create a `.npmrc` file in the root that contains:

   ```bash
   @jpl:registry=https://internal.npm.registry/
   ```

2. Configure your application to trust the self-signed cert for internal.npm.registry. There are various ways to do this (write-up of methods forthcoming)
3. Install the package and use assets as needed

   ```
   npm install @jpl/explorer-1
   ```

```

This package includes the base styles of Explorer 1 (typography, colors, spacing, etc.) which can be used in your projects via the TailwindCSS classes that are generated by Explorer 1's [TailwindCSS configuration](./tailwind.config.js). [Learn more about how to use TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

### Components

Not all components are included. A list of available components can be viewed in the `components[]` array in [jpl-ds.config.js](./jpl-ds.config.js). Components will be added in phases which are currently dictated by DesignLab's priority projects. If there is a component you would like to have included, please submit a feature request.

## Using bundled assets

Include all styles and javascript by adding the bundled css and js to your project:

```html
<!-- css -->
<link href="/dist/css/explorer-1.min.js" rel="stylesheet" />

<!-- javascript -->
<script src="/dist/js/explorer-1.min.js"></script>
```

Reference the [Explorer 1 Storybook](https://designlabinternal.domain/storybook/) for HTML snippets.

### Fonts

The bundled CSS references fonts with the relative path of `../fonts/`. You will need to add the fonts to your build process to ensure they are included in the relative path. An example of how to handle this is to write a node script that copies the `/dist/fonts/` folder to the correct path in your project.

## Using assets a la carte

Once the npm package is installed, you can import individual assets as needed. Below are some examples:

```scss
// a la carte component scss
@import '@jpl/explorer-1/src/scss/components/_BasePlaceholder';
```

```js
// a la carte js
require('@jpl/explorer-1/src/js/_detect-ie.js')
```

## Using the Explorer 1 Tailwind config

Below is an example of how to use the Explorer 1 TailwindCSS config in your own TailwindCSS config file. This can be useful if you want to set custom purge settings or any other overrides:

```js
// custom-app/tailwind.config.js

// import explorer 1's tailwind config
const explorer1Config = require('@jpl/explorer-1/tailwind.config.js')

module.exports = {
  ...explorer1Config,
  purge: ['../**/*.html'], // this will override explorer-1's purge settings

```

## For Contributing Developers

Documentation on how to run this project locally and add more components from the www storybook.

### Getting started

**Install dependencies**

```sh
npm i
```

**Serve at http://localhost:3000/**

```sh
# serve at http://localhost:3000/
# you may need to refresh if you've never run the project before
npm run dev
```

**Build to /dist**

```sh
npm run build
```

#### Included Components:

A list of included components can be viewed in the `components` array in [jpl-ds.config.js](./jpl-ds.config.js)

#### Important notes:

- The included components are currently arbitrary and geared toward testing. They can be selected by modifying `jpl-ds.config.js`
- `index.html` demos some html markup and scripts (lazyload) but it is not comprehensive and is not intended to be.
- Purge settings can be modified in `tailwind.purge.config.js`. Currently they are set to purge against www-frontend

#### Publishing to JPL's registry

Publishing has been configured according to the JPL Verdaccio documentation: https://internal.ghe.server/TPT/verdaccio. For publishing packages, you must use the non-aliased URL of `internal.npm.registry`

1. Login to the registry

   ```bash
   npm login --registry https://internal.npm.registry
   ```

2. Publish the package

   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```

### Configuration Files Explained

This repo contains several configuration files. Here is a breakdown of what each one is for:

| File                       | Description                                                                                                       | Src          |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------- |
| `jpl-ds.config.js`         | Main configuration file for this repo. Determines which components are included in the distributed design system. | local        |
| `tailwind.config.js`       | Tailwind CSS config file copied directly from www-frontend without making any changes                             | www-frontend |
| `tailwind.purge.config.js` | Purge configuration for this repo.                                                                                | local        |
| `postcss.config.js`        | PostCSS configuration for this repo. Note that purge settings are handled via tailwind configuration              | local        |

### Syncing with [www-frontend](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/www-frontend)

**To update assets:**

```sh
# update base tailwind, scss, and font files
npm run sync:base

# update component scss based on components configured in `jpl-ds.config.js`
npm run sync:components

# update all assets
npm run sync:all
```

> Assets are tracked in this repo.

#### How were the files sourced and what changes were made to them?

Several assets are copied from the www-frontend repo via npm scripts. Below is an outline of the copied files and their relation to this repo:

**Files that are copied from [frontend-www](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/www-frontend):**

- Tailwind config: `tailwind.config.js`
- SCSS files: entire `/assets/scss/` folder\*
- Webfonts: entire `/static/fonts/` folder
- Webfont CSS: `/static/styles/font-face.css`\*

\*All of the above files are untouched except for:

- `font-face.css`: automatically renamed to `_fonts.scss` and placed in `/src/scss/` via `npm sync:base`
- `/assets/scss/` folder has some files unique to this repo:
  - `styles.scss`: similar to the original `main.scss` but with key differences (see comments in file for more details)
  - `_fonts.scss`: updated and renamed from `font-face.css` via `npm sync:base`
  - `_components.scss`: the scss partial that imports all component scss in `/src/scss/components/`, which is built by this repo via `npm sync:components`
