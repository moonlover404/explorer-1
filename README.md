This package includes the base styles of Explorer 1 (typography, colors, spacing, etc.) which can be used in your projects via the TailwindCSS classes that are generated by Explorer 1's [TailwindCSS configuration](./tailwind.config.js). [Learn more about how to use TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

### Components

Not all components are included. A list of available components can be viewed in the `components[]` array in [www-sync.config.js](./www-sync.config.js). Components will be added in phases which are currently dictated by DesignLab's priority projects. If there is a component you would like to have included, please submit a feature request.

## Installation and usage

```bash
npm install @jpl/explorer-1
```

### Using bundled assets

Include all styles and scripts by adding the bundled CSS and JS to your project's HTML:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link href="/path/to/explorer-1.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- JavaScript -->
<script src="/path/to/explorer-1.min.js"></script>
```

(You will need to get the two files out of the installed package in `node_modules/@jpl/explorer-1/dist/`, place them somewhere in your project, and update the paths to point to the right location.)

Then reference the [Explorer 1 Storybook](https://nasa-jpl.github.io/explorer-1/) for HTML snippets you can use to create components.

#### Fonts

The bundled CSS references fonts with the relative path of `../fonts/`. You will need to add the fonts to your build process to ensure they are included in the relative path. An example of how to handle this is to write a Node script that copies the `/dist/fonts/` folder to the correct path in your project.

### Using assets a la carte

Instead of including all of the bundled CSS and JS, you can import individual assets as needed. Below are some examples:

```scss
// a la carte component SCSS
@import '@jpl/explorer-1/src/scss/components/_BasePlaceholder';
```

```js
// a la carte JS
require('@jpl/explorer-1/src/js/_detect-ie.js')
```

### Using the Explorer 1 Tailwind config

Below is an example of how to use the Explorer 1 TailwindCSS config in your own TailwindCSS config file. This can be useful if you want to set custom purge settings or any other overrides:

```js
// custom-app/tailwind.config.js

// import Explorer 1's Tailwind config
const explorer1Config = require('@jpl/explorer-1/tailwind.config.js')

module.exports = {
  ...explorer1Config,
  purge: ['../**/*.html'], // this will override Explorer 1's purge settings
}
```

## For contributing developers

Documentation on how to run this project locally and add more components from the www storybook.

### Getting started

1. Clone this repository and go into its directory
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
1. Serve at http://localhost:3000/
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   _Note: You may need to refresh if you've never run the project before._
1. Build to `dist/`
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

#### Included components

A list of included components can be viewed in the `components` array in [www-sync.config.js](./www-sync.config.js).

#### Important notes

- The included components are currently arbitrary and geared toward testing. They can be selected by modifying `www-sync.config.js`.
- `index.html` demos some HTML markup and scripts (lazyload) but it is not comprehensive and is not intended to be.
- Purge settings can be modified in `tailwind.purge.config.js`. Currently they are set to purge against www-frontend.

### Configuration files explained

This repo contains several configuration files. Here is a breakdown of what each one is for:

| File                       | Description                                                                                          | Source       |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------- |
| `www-sync.config.js`       | Configuration file for extracting files from www-frontend. Determines which components are included. | explorer-1   |
| `tailwind.config.js`       | Tailwind CSS config file copied directly from www-frontend                                           | www-frontend |
| `tailwind.purge.config.js` | Purge configuration for this repo.                                                                   | explorer-1   |
| `postcss.config.js`        | PostCSS configuration for this repo.                                                                 | explorer-1   |

### Syncing styles with www-frontend

Syncing with www-frontend means to extract SCSS from [www-frontend](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/www-frontend) for use in this package. This is a temporary solution until www-frontend is refactored to also use @jpl/explorer-1. File extraction is handled by the configuration file and scripts below and assumes that you have the `www-frontend` pulled locally, in a sibling folder to the jpl-design-system repo.

```
repos
├── jpl-design-system
└── www-frontend
```

Scripts that handle the extraction:
- `www-sync.config.js`
- `utils/buildBase.js`
- `utils/buildComponentScss.js`

**To update assets:**

```sh
# update base tailwind, scss, and font files
npm run sync:base

# update component scss based on components configured in `www-sync.config.js`
npm run sync:components

# update all assets
npm run sync:all
```

> Assets are tracked in this repo.

### JavaScript

JavaScript lives in `/src/js/` and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is used to bundle all imports and script files.

#### Adding to scripts.js

You can add more scripts as `require()` statements to the `/src/js/scripts.js` file. A few files are already included: `_detect-ie.js`, `_lazysizes_.js`, and `_swiper.js`.

#### Naming convention

Any script that will be required by `scripts.js` should start with an underscore, e.g.: `_my-script.js`.

#### Using Node modules

If you want to use Node modules, install the package as usual and add the necessary imports directly to `scripts.js` or a separate JS file that is then required in `scripts.js`. See `_lazysizes.js` as an example.

### Step-by-step instructions of how to import more components:

If the component has been deemed "part of the distributed design system" (i.e., its styles are truly one-to-one with [www-frontend](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/www-frontend/) in all use cases), then it should be added to this repo. If the design is customized for a specific use case, then add it manually to the project that needs the custom component. Do not add it to this repo.

Below are step-by-step instructions of how to import/add more components to the design system, using `BasePlaceholder` as an example:

1. First, this workflow requires that you have the `www-frontend` cloned locally, in a sibling folder to the jpl-design-system repo.
   ```
   repos
   ├── jpl-design-system
   └── www-frontend
   ```
2. Add the component name to `www-sync.config.js`
   ```js
   // www-sync.config.js
   components: [
     …
     "BasePlaceholder",
   ],
   ```
3. Sync component scss
   ```bash
   # repo root
   npm run sync:components
   ```
4. If the component includes custom functionality or JavaScript, it will need to be refactored manually. As an example, this has been done for [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/), the basis of all of our sliders/carousels: [src/js/_swiper.js](./src/js/_swiper.js). Details on how to add more scripts are documented under [JavaScript](#javascript).

#### How were the files sourced and what changes were made to them?

Several assets are copied from the www-frontend repo via npm scripts. Below is an outline of the copied files and their relation to this repo:

**Files that are copied from [frontend-www](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/www-frontend):**

- Tailwind config: `tailwind.config.js`
- SCSS files: entire `/assets/scss/` folder*
- Webfonts: entire `/static/fonts/` folder
- Webfont CSS: `/static/styles/font-face.css`*

\* All of the above files are untouched except for:

- `font-face.css`: automatically renamed to `_fonts.scss` and placed in `/src/scss/` via `npm sync:base`
- `/assets/scss/` folder has some files unique to this repo:
  - `styles.scss`: similar to the original `main.scss` but with key differences (see comments in file for more details)
  - `_fonts.scss`: updated and renamed from `font-face.css` via `npm sync:base`
  - `_components.scss`: the scss partial that imports all component scss in `/src/scss/components/`, which is built by this repo via `npm sync:components`

### Publishing to npm

1. Login to the public npm registry with your account that has permission to manage this package
   ```bash
   npm login
   ```
2. Publish the package
   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```
