# Components

Explorer 1 comprises components that range from very simple, single-purpose elements to complex combinations of multiple other components. We've categorized these into a few broad buckets, but the lines between them are blurry.

- **[Base](?path=/docs/components-base-overview--page)** components are the simplest elements that sometimes stand on their own, but more often are used in combination with others to assemble larger components. Examples include [BaseLink](?path=/docs/components-base-baselink--primary), [BaseButton](?path=/docs/components-base-basebutton--primary-button), and [BaseHeading](?path=/docs/components-base-baseheading--h-1).
- **[Blocks](?path=/docs/components-blocks-overview--page)** are components that combine multiple other components or are otherwise more complex. Examples include [BlockImage](?path=/docs/components-blocks-blockimage--standard), [BlockQuote](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/components-blocks-blockquote--default), and [BlockTeaser](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/components-blocks-blockteaser--default).
- We also break out **[Form](?path=/docs/components-forms-overview--overview)** and **[Search](?path=/docs/components-search-overview--page)** components into their own groups because they have their own significant complexities that relate to their user interactions.

## Comparing base components to block components

To further illustrate the difference between base and block components, consider images. We have both `BaseImage` and a `BlockImage` components. The difference is that `BaseImage` is nothing more than the `<img>` element (with our minimum set of attributes, wrapped in a div), whereas `BlockImage` combines a `BaseImage` with a `BaseImageCaption` (plus a few other bells and whistles).

### Examples

#### BaseImage

Just an image, nothing else.

<Canvas className="sbdocs-inline-height">
  <Story id="components-base-baseimage--default" />
</Canvas>

#### BaseImageCaption

Just the caption.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-base-baseimagecaption--default" />
</Canvas>

#### BlockImage

`BlockImage` = `BaseImage` + `BaseImageCaption`, plus adding support for expanding the image in a lightbox and styling it to be a full-bleed image.

<Canvas className="sbdocs-inline-height sbdocs-inline-height-xl">
  <Story id="components-blocks-blockimage--standard" />
</Canvas>
