## Using the Design System

### Step 1: Get the assets

CSS and JS have been precompiled and are available for download [here] (coming soon). These assets only include components meant for global use.

> TODO: documentation on how to use the assets

### Step 2: Get the HTML markup

You can retrieve the HTML code for each component like so:

- switch to the **Canvas** using the toolbar across the top of the page
- access the add-ons by hitting `A` on your keyboard. There is a known bug in Storybook where you may also need to toggle the add-on display position with `D` in order for them to appear.
- copy the HTML from the **HTML** add-on tab

## Background information

- [TailwindCSS](?path=/docs/appendix-tailwindcss--page)
- VueJS: the components are written in VueJS. If you are developing a Vue application, you may be able to re-use the source components directly. Contact DesignLab for more information.
